## Project Introduction
* 1. Use pytorch to implement intelligent classification of CIFAR10 dataset images
* 2. Use a small model, lightweight, with a 76% accuracy rate
* 3. Use pywebio as the web visualization framework, no need for front-end language, written in pure python. Lightweight, easy to reproduce, easy to deploy
